# Friendos Events

Hey, this is a repo exploring the Eventful and Google Maps APIs. I'm hoping to flesh it out into a place where my friends and I can go to and randomly find an event around the city. People will also be able to submit ideas for things to do in the rotation. 

I want to eventually get it into a WhatsApp chat bot. 

When the time comes, I'm planning on building the backend API in a message-based archetecture, probably on ServiceStack with SQL Server somewhere. Might be Postgres though.....Heroku likes Postgres better.
